Do you like playing card games? In this challenge, you have to calculate the value of a hand of cards. Write a function to do it. Your input is an string representing your cards (every card is represented by a value and a suit), and your output must be the total value of the set.

The suits are:

    C: Clubs
    D: Diamonds
    H: Hearts
    S: Spades

Card values are between 2 and 10. Figure values are:

    A = 11
    J, Q, K = 10

If only two suits are in the hand, add 10 points. If all cards are of the same suit, add 25 points.

Sample inputs:

    2C 10H AD KH 4S
    9H QD QC 3H 3D AC AH
    7C 8C AC 4D

Sample outputs:

    37
    57
    40
